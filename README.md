#Personal Verification based on Palm Prints using 2D Gabor Filter. 
A Biometics Project. The primary objective of the project was personal verification on the basis of biometric features. 
Focused on ‘Palmprint’ of a person to verify the identity and give access to the system post-verification to which the 
security module is installed. The algorithm used in the project was validated against the benchmark database publically 
available at “The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) Multispectral Palmprint Database” and achieved 92% accuracy.


The entire authentication methods depend on the same basic principle, which can be summarized as follows :
1) User provides an authenticator, a data item that can not be provided by anyone else (user’s palm here).
2) Authentication system contains a verifier, a data item that can verify the correctness of the authenticator
3) Authentication system uses a verification procedure, an algorithm that compares an authenticator with a verifier.
4) There is generally a base secret, a data item in user’s possession that	produces the authenticator.
